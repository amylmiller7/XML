Implementing the proper grant types and the required flows while securely protecting your secrets is challenging at best and catastrophic at worst. Fundamentally, professionals often struggle with OAuth because they misunderstand what it is, what use cases it is particularly good and bad at, and how to integrate it smoothly and safely into their systems. In this course, review the basics of OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect, and learn how to use them to authenticate your applications. Learn about tokens, scopes, and claims; OAuth flows; common security considerations; and more.</td><td>Lynda.com</td><td>Keith Casey</td><td>&mdash;</td><td>2019-09-25</td>

Join Keith Casey as he focuses on how to approach API testing by implementing a behavior-driven development model. Keith uses Gherkin to set up a Behat environment so you can see how to write and run your first test. Then, he shows how to build API test requests, including how to introduce variables, authenticate requests, and validate responses. He also covers refactoring tests, establishing system states, using extensions for batch operations, and more.</td><td>Lynda.com</td><td>Keith Casey</td><td>&mdash;</td><td>2019-09-16</td>
