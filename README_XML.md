## Notes

To view the project, do one of the following:

 * Copy URL method: Copy the following URL in Chrome or Safari. **Note:** Firefox does not use CSS so table is rendered without borders. http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/amylmiller7/XML/blob/master/OngoingEducation/OngoingEducationJava/OngoingEducation.html
